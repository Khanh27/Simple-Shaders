# ðŸŽ¨ Unity Image Effects: Custom Shaders

This repository contains a collection of custom post-processing shaders written in Unity. Each shader demonstrates a different visual effect using fragment shader techniques and Unity's depth or color buffer. Based on Daniel Ilett's Image Effect series.  

## ðŸ§ª Shaders Included

### ðŸ–¤ Greyscale Shader

Converts the rendered scene into greyscale by calculating **luminance** based on human visual sensitivity:
- Red contributes ~0.3
- Green ~0.59
- Blue ~0.11
- Each pixel's RGB is reduced to a single luminance value and applied uniformly.

### ðŸŸ¤ Sepia Tone Shader

Applies a vintage **sepia filter** by applying a 3Ã—3 matrix to the original RGB values. This mimics the warm, brownish tint of old photographs.

**Core Idea:**
Each output color channel is a weighted sum of all three input channels.

### ðŸŒˆ Neon Line Shader (Edge Detection)

Uses the **depth buffer** to detect edges in the scene, creating a glowing or outlined silhouette effect. Ideal for stylized visuals or highlighting objects.

- Based on Sobel Filter to find edges
- Can be combined with glow effects or colors for a "neon wireframe" look

### Kuwahara Filter 

Applies a stylized, painterly edge-preserving blur that smooths regions while retaining strong edges â€” ideal for toon shading or artistic rendering effects.

- Evaluates four regions around each pixel, selecting the one with the lowest variance to preserve edges.
- Produces a soft, abstract visual effect similar to hand-drawn or oil-painted images.
- Tunable blur radius allows control over smoothing strength and artistic intensity.
